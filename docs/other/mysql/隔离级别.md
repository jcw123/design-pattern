#### REPEATABLE READ
1. 通过第一次读取建立查询的snapshot，后续相同的查询直接使用这个快照的数据，保证了可重复读；

2. For a unique index with a unique search condition, InnoDB locks only the index record found, not the gap before it；

For other search conditions, InnoDB locks the index range scanned, using gap locks or next-key locks to block insertions by other sessions into the gaps covered by the range. For information about gap locks and next-key locks,


#### READ COMMITTED

1. Each consistent read, even within the same transaction, sets and reads its own fresh snapshot(最新的数据快照)

#### READ UNCOMMITTED

#### SERIALIZABLE
